# 🐔 Miss Pecky — Offline Experimental Voice Assistant

> “We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.”  
> — Marshall McLuhan

Miss Pecky is not just a technical demo — it’s a **statement**.

Developed entirely in **Node.js**, powered by **Piper TTS** and running **100% offline**, this assistant merges natural language synthesis with a customizable character engine to explore the edges of **privacy-first AI**, **edge computing**, and **voice interaction without the cloud**.

## 🎓 Why This Project?

As a student pursuing a **double degree in International Business & Data Science (ESIC)** and **Computer Engineering (UNIR)** — with past coursework at **VU Amsterdam** and a recently done 6 weeks course made by **Imperial College London** — I’ve always been driven by the intersection of technology, society, and autonomy.

This project was born from a question:

> *Can we create expressive, character-driven, offline AI assistants that respect user privacy, are fully hackable, and feel alive — without Big Tech?*

Miss Pecky is my first step toward answering that.
